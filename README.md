# Understanding_machine_learning_Algo
There are multiple basic projects under this section in order to understand the simple machine learning Algorithms.

Linear_Reg_practical_Implmentation : The proposed codeflow of linear regression predicts the housing prices for california housing dataset. The code uses python version of 3.10.12. The dataset is imported from the scikitlearn.

Handwriting Digit recog: The idea is to classify the handwritten digits using the decision tree algorithm. The input to the model is a csv file consisting of images mapped into pixels.
